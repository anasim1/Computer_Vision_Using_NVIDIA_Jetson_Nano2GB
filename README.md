# Computer_Vision_Using_NVIDIA_Jetson_Nano2GB

## Inspiration: 
I worked for sometime at a postal place where they create shipping labels, and prepare shipping packages for the customers. They have a big collection of different sizes of boxes in their store. The employees either eye-ball the size of the things to be sent or measure it to get an idea of which box to find and pack the stuff in the box for shipping.

## Objective: 
I developed a computer vision product that measures/suggests a box size from the available boxes in the store when the employee displays the stuff to be shipped in front of the camera.

## The How:

<ul>NVIDIA's Jetson Nano 2GB</ul>
<ul>Docker Container: L4T R32.7.1</ul>
<ul>Library: https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/</ul>

## Experience:
It was a great experience working into Practical AI and being able to create a bot as a PoC for shipping process efficiency. This helped me develop my skillset in object detection inference using NVIDIA's Toolkit.
